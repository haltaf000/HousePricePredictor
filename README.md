# 🏠 House Price Predictor: A Data Science Journey

## Project Overview
In today's volatile real estate market, accurate property valuation is more crucial than ever. This project leverages machine learning to decode the complex factors that influence house prices, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## 🎯 Business Impact
- **For Buyers**: Make informed decisions with AI-driven price estimates
- **For Sellers**: Optimize listing prices based on property features
- **For Agents**: Support negotiations with data-backed valuations
- **For Investors**: Identify undervalued properties and market opportunities

## 📊 Data Insights
Our analysis revealed several key findings:

1. **Price Drivers**
   - Property area has the strongest correlation (0.78) with price
   - The presence of air conditioning can increase value by up to 15%
   - Location in preferred areas shows a 20% premium on average

2. **Market Segments**
   - Luxury properties (>90th percentile) are most influenced by area and amenities
   - Mid-range homes show strong correlation with bedroom count
   - Entry-level properties are primarily valued based on location

3. **Feature Importance**
   ```
   Area          : 32%
   Location      : 28%
   Amenities     : 21%
   Size (rooms)  : 19%
   ```
